## Python 3 Text Based Game Engine (with demo mode!)
<br>
**Description:**<br>
The engine to a Zork-like text game-- written entirely in Python 3
This particular version contains a simple demonstration of how to implement rooms, items, and simple commands into the game. There is also a "demo mode" in this code which you will be prompted to activate upon running the code. Try it, it's fun.
<br>
<br>
**To Run:**<br>
Simply run "main.py" in any interactive interpreter. (Be sure to use Python 3!)
<br>
<br>
**Just a Heads Up:**<br>
This was a project for me to learn more about object oriented programming in Python 3. It's not complete, and I'm probably not going to complete it anytime soon, but you should be able to play through the demo in about 5 minutes. I made the demo on an airplane, so there's at least one really hacky line in there somewhere. If you'd like a larger version of a game built with this engine, email me and I can send you something I was working on before I made this demo.
<br>
<br>
**One Other Thing:**<br>
If you enjoy this type of thing, and would like to play more games like it, Google "Zork" and look for the free online version of that amazing game. This game is based entirely off of Zork's interface, though it is still lacking a lot of Zork's robustness.
